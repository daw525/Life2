Splint 3.1.1 --- 12 April 2003

../Source/main.c: (in function main)
../Source/main.c(22,13): Unrecognized identifier: Sleep
  Identifier used in code has not been declared. (Use -unrecog to inhibit
  warning)
../Source/mapping.c: (in function initialiseMapping)
../Source/mapping.c(5,6): Arrow access from possibly null pointer m:
                             m->evaluation
  A possibly null pointer is dereferenced.  Value is either the result of a
  function which may return null (in which case, code should check it is not
  null), or a global, parameter or structure field declared with the null
  qualifier. (Use -nullderef to inhibit warning)
   ../Source/mapping.c(3,43): Storage m may become null
../Source/mapping.c(7,5): Implicitly only storage m->outputPort.e (type entity
    *) not released before assignment: m->outputPort.e = output
  A memory leak has been detected. Only-qualified storage is not released
  before the last reference to it is lost. (Use -mustfreeonly to inhibit
  warning)
../Source/mapping.c(7,5): Implicitly temp storage output assigned to implicitly
                             only: m->outputPort.e = output
  Temp storage (associated with a formal parameter) is transferred to a
  non-temporary reference. The storage may be released or new aliases created.
  (Use -temptrans to inhibit warning)
../Source/mapping.c(13,9): Implicitly only storage m->inputPorts[].e (type
    entity *) not released before assignment: m->inputPorts[inputPort].e = 0
../Source/mapping.c(19,2): Function returns with null storage derivable from
                              parameter m->inputPorts[].e
  A possibly null pointer is reachable from a parameter or global variable that
  is not declared using a /*@null@*/ annotation. (Use -nullstate to inhibit
  warning)
   ../Source/mapping.c(13,38): Storage m->inputPorts[].e becomes null
../Source/mapping.c: (in function addInputPortToMapping)
../Source/mapping.c(32,9): Implicitly temp storage input assigned to implicitly
                              only: m->inputPorts[m->inputPortCount].e = input
