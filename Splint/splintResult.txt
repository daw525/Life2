Splint 3.1.1 --- 12 April 2003

../Source/configure.c: (in function parseLine)
../Source/configure.c(194,29): Use of != with boolean variables (risks
    inconsistency because of multiple true values): failure != true
  Two bool values are compared directly using a C primitive. This may produce
  unexpected results since all non-zero values are considered true, so
  different true values may not be equal. The file bool.h (included in
  splint/lib) provides bool_equal for safe bool comparisons. (Use -boolcompare
  to inhibit warning)
../Source/configure.c(196,33): Use of != with boolean variables (risks
    inconsistency because of multiple true values): failure != true
../Source/configure.c: (in function openFile)
../Source/configure.c(241,35): Function fgets expects arg 2 to be int gets
                                  size_t: sizeof((buffer))
  To allow arbitrary integral types to match any integral type, use
  +matchanyintegral.
../Source/configure.c(241,45): Possibly null storage file passed as non-null
                                  param: fgets (..., file)
  A possibly null pointer is passed as a parameter corresponding to a formal
  parameter with no /*@null@*/ annotation.  If NULL may be used for this
  parameter, add a /*@null@*/ annotation to the function parameter declaration.
  (Use -nullpass to inhibit warning)
   ../Source/configure.c(234,12): Storage file may become null
../Source/configure.c(247,39): Function fgets expects arg 2 to be int gets
                                  size_t: sizeof((buffer))
../Source/main.c: (in function main)
../Source/main.c(25,13): Unrecognized identifier: Sleep
  Identifier used in code has not been declared. (Use -unrecog to inhibit
  warning)
../Source/mapping.c: (in function initialiseMapping)
../Source/mapping.c(7,5): Implicitly only storage m->outputPort.p (type bool *)
    not released before assignment: m->outputPort.p = output
  A memory leak has been detected. Only-qualified storage is not released
  before the last reference to it is lost. (Use -mustfreeonly to inhibit
  warning)
../Source/mapping.c(7,5): Implicitly temp storage output assigned to implicitly
                             only: m->outputPort.p = output
  Temp storage (associated with a formal parameter) is transferred to a
  non-temporary reference. The storage may be released or new aliases created.
  (Use -temptrans to inhibit warning)
../Source/mapping.c(13,9): Implicitly only storage m->inputPorts[].p (type bool
    *) not released before assignment: m->inputPorts[inputPort].p = NULL
../Source/mapping.c(19,2): Function returns with null storage derivable from
                              parameter m->inputPorts[].p
  A possibly null pointer is reachable from a parameter or global variable that
  is not declared using a /*@null@*/ annotation. (Use -nullstate to inhibit
  warning)
   ../Source/mapping.c(13,38): Storage m->inputPorts[].p becomes null
../Source/mapping.c: (in function addInputPortToMapping)
../Source/mapping.c(32,9): Implicitly temp storage input assigned to implicitly
                              only: m->inputPorts[m->inputPortCount].p = input
../Source/mapping.c: (in function evaluateMapping)
../Source/mapping.c(64,13): Assignment of bool * to bool:
                               inputPortState = m->inputPorts[inputPort].p
  Types are incompatible. (Use -type to inhibit warning)
../Source/configure.c(6,12): Variable exported but not used outside configure:
                                REGION_TOK
  A declaration is exported, but not used outside this module. Declaration can
  use static qualifier. (Use -exportlocal to inhibit warning)
